### Problem: Workshop
Assumptions:

A certain workshop has a total of four employees. <br>
One person takes orders to repair X equipment, and the other three carry out these repairs. <br>
The workshop can accommodate a maximum of 10 pieces of X equipment. <br>
The person taking the orders accepts the equipment for repair one by one from clients and puts the items to be repaired on a shelf. <br>
When any of the three workers repairing the equipment is free, he takes an item from the repair shelf and repairs it. <br>
Once repaired, the repairman hands it to a courier for shipment back to the customer. 
The courier delivers repaired devices back to the clients from his buffer.

### Solution
My solution to this problem is based on the producer-consumer problem using Semaphores.
I created three buffers: Clients - Order Worker buffer (N - 1), Order Worker - Repair Workers (1 - 3) buffer and Repair Workers - Delivery Man buffer (3-1) and synchronized all threads to use these different buffers securely and communicate with each other making the process comes full circle.
